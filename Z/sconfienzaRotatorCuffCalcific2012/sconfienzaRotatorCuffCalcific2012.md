US appearance of the calcium deposit was classified as hard (when manifesting with a hyperechoic rim and a strong posterior acoustic shadow) (Fig 2a), soft (when manifesting with a homogeneous hyperechoic appearance without posterior acoustic shadow) (Fig 2b), or fluid (when manifesting with a thin peripheral hyperechoic rim and a hypoechoic and/or anechoic center) (Fig 2c)"

with room-temperature saline (P , .001). Results of a subgroup analysis according to calcification appearance at US showed that the difference in ease of calcium dissolution was not significant for fluid deposits (P = .999),"
