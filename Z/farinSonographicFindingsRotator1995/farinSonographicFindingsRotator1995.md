Type I: a large deposit or deposits (diameter over 1 em) in the cuff or in the bursa (Fig. 1); type II: several small scattered calcifications (Fig. 4); type ill: only a few small deposits (Fig. 5)."

when analyzing radiographic and sonographic findings, we found no statistically significant correlation between poorly defined calcifications on plain films and calcifications without shadow on sonograms"

It is generally accepted that a tissue hypoxia makes the so-called critical zone of the rotatorcuff vulnerable to calcification. Initial necrosis of this zoneis postulated to to be succeededby calcification."

The exact mechanism of calcium deposition has been a matter of speculation"

# text

When examining ultrasound transmission through calcifications, no reliable correlation was found between calcifications without shadow on sonograms and poorly defined calcifications (resorptive phase) on plainfilms. From a treatment point of view (needle aspiration and lavage versus surgery), this information could give valuable advice when planning and scheduling appropriate treatment."
