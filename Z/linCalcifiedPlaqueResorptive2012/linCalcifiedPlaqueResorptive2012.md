Gärtner and Heyer [9] studied 235 calcific deposits of the shoulder joint visualized on X-ray and classified them as type I (dense appearance an clearly circumscribed), type II (translucent and cloudy without clear circumscription), and type III (without a specific morphology). The French Society of Arthroscopy defines rotator cuff calcifications by appearance on X-ray as type A (homogenous, well-defined limits), type B (heterogenous, fragmented, well-defined limits), type C (heterogenous, poorly defined limits) and type D (dystrophic pattern) [10]. Farin and Jaroma [11] described three types of calcifications found with ultrasound: (1) hyperechoic focus with a well-defined shadow, (2) hyperechoic focus with a faint shadow, and (3) hyperechoic focus with no shadow"

Approximately 10% of patients who do not respond well to the aforementioned treatment strategies, or experience a progressive course, require surgery"

It has recently been reported that conservative treatments fail in approximately 30% of patients with calcific tendiosis of the shoulder, regardless of the form of the plaques"
