The French Society of Arthroscopy defines rotator cuff calcifications by appearance on X-ray as type A (homogenous, well-defined limits), type B (heterogenous, fragmented, well-defined limits), type C (heterogenous, poorly defined limits) and type D (dystrophic pattern) [10]. Farin and Jaroma [11] described three types of calcifications found with ultrasound: (1) hyperechoic focus with a well-defined shadow, (2) hyperechoic focus with a faint shadow, and (3) hyperechoic focus with no shadow"
