To manage all notes in their various stages of processing I use this General utility notes that are tagged with [#🧠️/⚙️](https://publish.obsidian.md/#%F0%9F%A7%A0%EF%B8%8F/%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F) such as this [💳️ Kanban](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Utility/%F0%9F%92%B3%EF%B8%8F+Kanban) note or this one [Utility/💳️ Kanban Live](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Utility/%F0%9F%92%B3%EF%B8%8F+Kanban+Live). I also keep track of input processing and daily notes with [ISO 8601](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/ISO+8601) date stamps in the titles of the notes which are laid out chronologically here: [Utility/🕓️ Timeline](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Utility/%F0%9F%95%93%EF%B8%8F+Timeline).

To really explore and jump off into this vault you should start with the [Maps of Content](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Z/Map+Of+Content) which are all found easily with [#🧠️/🗺️](https://publish.obsidian.md/#%F0%9F%A7%A0%EF%B8%8F/%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8F). The Map of MOC is gone because it's more effort than it's worth to maintain and the MOC's are becoming more free form and connecting to each other and there's no longer a point in trying to code a structure around a free form network graph.
