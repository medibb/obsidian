The predicted amplitude of the EAG voltage for a normal human subject is 0.174 mV,"
Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LLE3RKEH?page=2&annotation=3B5XGEBR)


The peak-to-peak EAG displacement is ~ 0.25 mV"

Angle D represents a sector of the disk that is generating most of the voltage signal at P from displaced molecular dipoles"

The right hand volume at a particular positive value of x generates a positive signal at P, and being farther away, the left hand volume at the corresponding negative value of x generates a smaller negative signal at P."

thickness 에 따라 signal 이 커진다면 무릎 굴곡각도에 따라 contact area가 후방으로 이동할때 thickness 도 얇아지므로 eag크기가 점차 감소할 수도 있다.

the EAG appears to be an indirect linear measure of the diameter and thickness of the cartilage. Further, the signal is generated mostly by tissue near the outer rim that is facing the electrode on the skin surface"
Yellow Highlight [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LLE3RKEH?page=21&annotation=JAUWP8US)


EAG measurements are very sensitive to electrode placement. Doubling the sensing electrode distance in terms of disk radii,  , reduces the EAG signal by a factor of eight."
