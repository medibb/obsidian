# text
The strain-generated potential (SGP) is a well-established mechanism in cartilaginous tissues whereby mechanical forces generate electrical potentials"

numerical models to-date have negated ferroelectric effects in the SGP and have utilised classic Donnan theory that, as evidence argues, may be oversimplified."

강유전 효과가 없고 고식적인 donnan theropy 만을 얘기하는 것은 맞지 않다.



The SGP, and these mechanisms behind it, are finally discussed in relation to the cell response"

SGP 에 대한 보고는 결국은 cell response와 연결지어 고찰되어야 함. EAG도 마찬가지.

As such, the mechanobiology of the IVD have been identified as key processes in maintaining tissue or inducing degeneration (Vergroesen et al. 2015), while the mechanotransduction pathways involved remain poorly understood (Fearing et al. 2018; Molladavoodi et al. 2020)"

Most known mechanosensors in both tissues are thought to be signalled by deformations of the local extracellular matrix (ECM) or pericellular matrix (PCM) (Zhao et al. 2020)."

The mechanotransduction pathways involved in IVD cells and chondrocytes have been reviewed in-depth elsewhere and thus is beyond the scope of this review (Sanchez-Adams et al. 2014; Fearing et al. 2018)."

A well-established mechanism in these tissues in response to loading, distinct from mechanical cues, is the strain-generated potential (SGP)"

SGPs were later observed across several types of cartilage (Bassett and Pawluk 1972), widening the field of stress-induced remodelling to soft tissues"

SGP는 1966년에 먼저 발견되었고, 1972년에 몇가지 연골에서 발견되었으며, stress-induced remodelling of soft tissue에 대해서 말하고 있음.
piezoelectricity 조차도 폐조직에서 조차 보고되었음 2017, 2018

The highly hydrated nature of these tissues has made Donnan, diffusion and streaming potentials the dominant topic"

Cartilaginous tissues must follow the law of electroneutrality; that is, the tissue must carry a zero net charge."

fixed-charge density (FCD). Proteoglycans are the primary component in cartilaginous tissue that contribute to the FCD. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)"

단어 정의

The IVD is subjected to a diurnal loading pattern throughout the day, whereby approximately 25% of tissue fluid is exuded by the pressure of external forces during daytime activity and subsequently imbibed during rest at night (Sivan et al. 2006)."

AC similarly undergoes a diurnal cycle of fluid exudation/recovery of water content, where diurnal strains can be expected to range between 1 and 6%, dependent on AC location"
