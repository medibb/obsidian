Confidential Comments to the Editor-in-Chief

# Reject 


Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript recently submitted to ARM journal. I appreciate the chance to evaluate this work. I am not able to recommend this manuscript for publication, and I do not believe it meets the high standards required for publication in this journal because of the study is not valid as a aspect of subjects heterogenicity, unclear causality of effects of their intervention. Details are written in the attached file.

I appreciate your discretion in this matter and look forward to the opportunity to review future submissions.

Sincerely,

Jaehyun Lee

Dear Editor,

I am writing to provide my feedback on the manuscript that was recently submitted to your esteemed journal. I appreciate the opportunity to review this manuscript and believe it has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field.

However, I have some concerns about the methodology and analysis presented in the manuscript that I would prefer to discuss in confidence. While I believe these concerns can be addressed, I do not wish to disclose them publicly in this review.

I understand that this may pose some challenges for the authors in addressing these concerns, but I feel it is necessary to ensure the quality and accuracy of the manuscript. Therefore, I request that my comments remain confidential and not be shared with the authors.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

Comments to the Author  
The authors conduct an interesting study on the influence of Forward head posture correction using a global(cervicothoracic & lumbopelvic) spinal program on a craniovertebral angle, neck disability, and spinal muscle activity.  
While the global spine exercise program may be able to improve more NDI than a cervicothoracic program, I do not see how this is rationally inferred from this paper. Although this study speculated that FHP patients have muscle imbalance and myofascial pain, which could be improved through global spinal exercise, it did not actually address the observational evidence of muscle imbalance and pain characteristics and their changes. In Addition, the underlying causes of pain and neck disability in comparison groups could be highly diverse, thus interpreting the results is too speculative.  
I believe that ensure subject homogenicity in comparison groups and providing further reasoning for how the exercise program could improve CVA, along with a more comprehensive and biomechanical explanation, would be necessary.

- page2 
	- line 33 - the 9th reference do not adequately support the statement "This postural malalignment is associated with muscle imbalance." Therefore, additional appropriate references may be necessary.
	- line 37 The assumption that many FHP subjects do not have neck pain does not explain the need to correct all FHP cases with spinal muscle imbalance.
	- line 40 - Similarly to the previous sentence, it is necessary to provide a detailed explanation of which muscles have a muscle imbalance, how this creates FHP and causes pain, and what exercises correct the muscle imbalance and spinal alignment.
	- line 42 - A reference is needed to support the claim that cervicothoracic intervention improves flexibility and strength.
- page 3
	-  Line 59: This information is more appropriate for the Method section.
	
- page 4
	- line 71 - Were individuals who underwent surgery excluded based solely on medical history? Were imaging modalities used to exclude surgical deformities, cervicothoracic spine disorders, birth defects, or anatomic variations? What criteria were used to determine "severe pain"? How was pain quantified? Was a validated scale used?
	- There is a need for a robust subject description to determine whether degenerative disc disease (including internal disc derangement), birth defects, tumors, infections, and systemic diseases that are not described in the exclusion criteria could be co-variables for pain and CV angle reduction. In many cases, segmental sagittal imbalance caused by degenerative disc disease could create baseline differences between comparison groups, and therefore it is necessary to address this issue.
	- Line 74: Since young women under 30 years old who are students or work in hospitals are a very limited sample, it would be appropriate to report in the title and conclusions, as well as in the limitations section. If NDI is mild to moderate in young women under 30 years old, it is necessary to clarify whether they have underlying diseases, whether they have non-specific neck pain, and the duration of their symptoms. Otherwise, it is necessary to show how the heterogeneous causes of painful necks were controlled between the comparison groups.
	- line 75 - Evidence is needed to support the claim that the prevalence of NDI is high in women, despite their weaker muscle strength. Reference 20 does not provide sufficient evidence for this claim.
- page 5
	- line 100 - The technical aspects seem to be well described. However, it is necessary to describe how the patients were instructed to stand and where they were directed to look. It is also important to describe how the camera measurement may be affected by head and trunk rotation and how this was controlled or adjusted for.
- page 6
	- line 122 - Providing a detailed description of the experimental method used in the previous study would be helpful for readers who are new to this topic. The reference states that maximal resistance was applied to the subjects in a sitting position during MVIC measurement for CES. It would be necessary to describe where the maximal resistance was applied among the ROMs of the neck. 
- Page 7
	- A true control group that did not undergo the prescribed intervention is necessary. If ethical considerations prohibit withholding treatment, a description of such decisions should be included. However, creating a control group that received only postural education or physical therapy is unlikely to raise ethical concerns. Otherwise, the natural course of transient CV angle reduction and improvement due to the natural improvement of neck pain cannot be excluded.
- page 9
	- line 177 - To ensure accurate comparison, it seems important to record in detail in the method section whether MVIC measurement was taken in the same neck posture. If CES %MVIC was measured in retracted head position, it could be interpreted as a reduciton of the external flexion moment produced by gravity
- page 10
	- line 203 - It is reported that four weeks of exercise do not actually result in muscle lengthening, but rather an increase in extensibility due to modified sensation. If there have been reports indicating that actual lengthening occurred with only four weeks of exercise, then corresponding observational evidence should be presented. Therefore, it would be more accurate to present observational evidence suggesting either lengthening as an outcome or an increase in extensibility.
	- line 206 - It is necessary to explain and interpret how the preceding lumbopelvic program, which was implemented in this study, was thought to increase the CV angle through what process. Was the initial lumbosacral angle in a state of lordosis or kyphosis that could significantly affect the CV angle?

- page 11
	  - Line 223 - It is necessary to provide the rationale for how lumbosacral soft tissue elongation and strengthening may have reduced neck disability.
	  - Line 225 - the sentence describing the reduction of myofascial fiber stress and pain through the implemented global spinal exercise leaves unclear whether the subjects had pre-existing lumbar spinal pain and whether the improvement in lumbar pain may have affected the NDI scores. Therefore, it is important to address whether only neck pain was investigated in NDI assessment.
	  - Line 230 - It is necessary to distinguish whether the sentence that pain and discomfort were reduced refers to neck pain or lumbar pain. If it refers to the reduction of neck pain, it is necessary to describe in detail what the reasons are for the reduction.
	  - Line 233 - Observational evidence needs to be presented for changes in whole spine alignment.
