# 1 INTRODUCTION

==Knee cartilage is our main concern to understand and treat the knee joint pain==. Physicians usually observe the damaged cartilage after injury by performing diagnostic test from the physical examination to medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging, but early cartilage damage or only functional change except morphological deformity could not found. Some methodologic modalities such as nuclear medicine imaging show the hypermetabolism of subchondral bone, but the resolution is ambiguous and still do not show the cartilage function directly.

==Determining the loads on joints based on their movements is a key element in the use of exercise techniques.== For that purpose, the impact of joint cartilage during physical activities were investigated and reported in several in vivo experiments using sensor in prosthetics and biomechanical method. But biomechanics of artificially replaced knee is already differed by itself, and mathematical computation using kinematic parameters are only an indirect estimate.

The cartilage potential can be generated mainly by streaming potential due to the local force applied to cartilage and other physiologies such as electro-osmolality due to glycosaminoglycans also had a roll in producing the electrical potentials on cartilage. The new technique that recording the cartilage potentials, ==the electroarthrography was previously introduced as a novel method to assess articular cartilage== by a few previous research for knee and elbow. The authors show that reduced and absent EAG signal from osteoarthritic knee and replaced knee, respectively. And the authors also represent the affecting factors of EAG such as center of gravity, muscular contraction across the knee joint, and repeated loading. Thus, early physical change of the cartilage even before morphologic changes could be explored by observing the electric potentials of cartilage tissue during load bearing. ¬†

==However, reliable electrode system is not clinically validated yet== (by mathematical modeling and bunch of electrode but not considered the conducting soft tissue even though they performed the in vivo study and animal study) and the interpretation of signal are restricted in standing posture. The methodological values of EAG could be reinforced by achieving reliability and reproducibility during actual exercise movements. For that, Standardized electrode position which reliably detect electrical signal of cartilage despite differences in individual anatomy and biomechanics of exercise of the knee joint is needed. Furthermore, through monitoring the EAG, evaluating the hazard of rehabilitative exercise could be achievable.

To the knowledge of the authors, ==it is the first study to report the electrical potentials of knee joints during exercise movement in vivo==. In this study, the authors identified the reliable surface electrode location that can obtain analyzable information of the knee cartilage, analyze the characteristics of the electric potentials, and develop feasible parameters in clinic.

  

# 2 METHODS

This study is a prospective cohort study with Level ___3 evidence.

## 2.1 Patients

We enrolled the 18~40 years old healthy subjects and received the informed consent. Subjects who has A, B, C were excluded. We intended to drop out the subjects who want to stop during experiments with discomfort, pain or any other reason, but no one dropped out from our experiments. Finally, A subjects were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  A University and was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.

## 2.2 Clinical parameters

Demographic data, including... 

Second, 

Lastly, 

## 2.3 A analysis 


## 2.4 Post-processing of A data





## 2.6 Statistical analysis

'A parameters' were analyzed with the T test with a significance of _p_ < 0.05. To adjust for baseline imbalance between groups, we proceeded with a multivariable analysis using TT test. The demographic and clinical parameters were used as covariates and magnitude of effects were reported with the effect size based on estimate of GLM, 
All statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical software version 3.5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
