- Task list
	- 주제 정하기
		- 서론
			1. RA에서 운동을 왜 다르게 해야하는가?
				1. 기존 연구의 근거
					1. 염증성질환에서 운동의 전신적효과
					   : 유산소운동 및 근력운동의 전신효과 ==근거수집==
					2.  운동이 synovitis와 부착부염의 진행을 막는가?
					3. 운동이 염증성 통증을 완화하는가? 근거?전신?
					4. RA에서 joint proprioception 은? 염증이 있다가 없어지면 떨어지지 않을까?
					5. 그 외 관절가동범위의유지? / 기능? / 악화예방과 합병증의 관리? / 유연성
					   
				2.  ==내가 추가할 내용==
					1. 관절내압상승과 허혈성손상
					2. synovium stiffness 및 hyperplasia / pannus 등으로 인한 hypomobilization of meniscus..etc - biomechanics break.. 
		- 본론
			1. RA에서 운동은 어떻게 해야하는가?
				1. RA에서도 지켜야하는 일반적인 자가운동 주의사항
					1. 유전적 성향의 고려 (Not RA관련 but mechnical stress에 대한 feasiblity)
					2. 나이의 고려 - 고중량 저반복 보다는 고령에서 저중량 고반복
					3. 그 외 - lifestyle modification, 피드백? 통증이 생기면 중지. 나중엔 digitalHC
				2. RA에서 더욱 조심해야하는 자가운동 주의사항
					1. Weight bearing tissue의 로딩이 적은 방법
					2. 관절가동범위 - 전범위로 활용 - ==과도한 스트레칭이 좋은가?==
			2. RA 외 질환의 자가운동은 어떻게 해야하는가? 
				1. 유산소, 대근육의 운동
				2. ==생활자세를 최대한 neutral position을 중심으로 ROM을 하며 지내면서 강직에 대비?== - 재활 스트록 환자의 개념. 이왕 굳을 거 기능적 자세에서 굳힌다.

			- 예시: 유산소를 꾸준히하고 근력운동은 분할프로그램을 하는데 inflammed joint, active disease 있는 joint의 부하를 최대한 덜가하는 방식의 운동을 시행하고, 통증이 있으면 멈추며, 미리 steroid inj 등으로 염증을 줄이는 것이 좋고, stiffness등과 부착부 과도한 strain 을 제외하기 위해 100%가 안되는 관절가동범위의 운동을 한다. 쉬울것 같은 운동프로그램을 소개한다( 예를 또 들면, 엉덩이벌리기, 시티드로우, 종아리들기..질병의 활성도 감소된 이후에는 균형운동과, 염증회복 후 관절강직의 치료를 위한 스트레칭운동을 병행한다. 근육의 점진적 강도 증진은 미리미리 해두면 관절보호에 좋겠다. 다만 관절파괴가 심한 사람은 관절기능의 유지에 중점을 두는 것이 좋겠다)

## The effect of physical exercise on rheumatoid arthritis: An overview of systematic reviews

This article is an overview of 10 systematic reviews that examined the effects of different types of exercise on various outcomes for people with rheumatoid arthritis. The authors found that:

Aerobic exercise improved aerobic capacity1
Strength training improved erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation) and 50-foot walking time1
Aerobic exercise combined with strength training improved aerobic capacity, physical function, and fatigue1
Hand exercise improved hand function1
Tai chi improved pain, stiffness, physical function, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and quality of life1
Yoga improved pain, disability, mood, and quality of life1
The authors concluded that exercise is beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis and recommended that health professionals should encourage them to participate in regular physical activity tailored to their individual needs and preferences.



## Physical activity, exercise and rheumatoid arthritis: Effectiveness, mechanisms and implementation1

This article is a review of the current evidence on how physical activity and exercise can benefit people with rheumatoid arthritis. The authors discussed:

The effectiveness of physical activity and exercise for improving symptoms such as pain, fatigue, disability, mood, sleep quality, and cardiovascular health1
The mechanisms by which physical activity and exercise can modulate inflammation, immune function, muscle strength, body composition, bone health, vascular function, and brain activity in rheumatoid arthritis1
The implementation of physical activity interventions in clinical practice, including barriers, facilitators, strategies, guidelines, recommendations, and examples of successful programs1
The authors concluded that physical activity and exercise are safe and effective interventions that can improve both local and systemic outcomes for people with rheumatoid arthritis. They suggested that rheumatology healthcare practitioners should lead the implementation of physical activity interventions in a pragmatic manner and supported by social innovation.




## Patient experiences of physical activity and exercise in rheumatoid arthritis: a qualitative study1

This article is a qualitative study that explored the views and experiences of people with rheumatoid arthritis regarding physical activity and exercise. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants who had varying levels of physical activity and exercise. The authors analyzed the data using thematic analysis and identified four main themes:

The meaning of physical activity and exercise: Participants had different definitions and understandings of what constituted physical activity and exercise, ranging from daily activities to structured programs1
The benefits and challenges of physical activity and exercise: Participants reported various benefits of being physically active or exercising, such as improved mood, mobility, pain management, self-esteem, social interaction, and quality of life. They also faced various challenges, such as fatigue, pain, fear of damage, lack of motivation, time constraints, accessibility issues, weather conditions, and conflicting advice1
The role of health professionals: Participants valued the support and guidance from health professionals regarding physical activity and exercise. They appreciated when health professionals were knowledgeable, empathetic, encouraging, realistic, individualized, flexible, consistent, and collaborative1
The role of self-management: Participants recognized the importance of self-management skills for engaging in physical activity and exercise. They used strategies such as goal setting, planning ahead, pacing themselves, listening to their bodies, monitoring their progress, rewarding themselves, seeking social support, and adapting to changing circumstances1
The authors concluded that physical activity and exercise are complex phenomena that are influenced by personal, social, environmental, and professional factors. They suggested that health professionals should adopt a patient-centered approach that considers the individual preferences, needs, and goals of people with rheumatoid arthritis.


# SpA exercise

## Exercise therapy for spondyloarthritis: a systematic review 
- This article is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of therapeutic exercise on pain, stiffness, quality of life, function, disease activity, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with spondyloarthritis. The authors found moderate evidence that exercise therapy improved pain, function, disease activity, and spinal mobility compared to usual care or no intervention1

- summary:  This article is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of therapeutic exercise on pain, stiffness, quality of life, function, disease activity, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with spondyloarthritis. The authors searched electronic databases and included 14 studies with a total of 1,032 participants. The authors performed a meta-analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
- The authors found:
	Moderate evidence that exercise therapy improved pain, function, disease activity, and chest expansion compared to usual care or no intervention1
	Low-level evidence that exercise therapy improved stiffness, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory function compared to usual care or no intervention1
	No evidence that exercise therapy improved quality of life compared to usual care or no intervention1
	No evidence that exercise therapy was superior to other interventions such as massage, hydrotherapy, or education1
	No evidence that different types or dosages of exercise therapy had different effects on outcomes1
	
- The authors concluded that therapeutic exercises are beneficial for adults with ankylosing spondylitis; effects on other spondyloarthritis subtypes are unknown. They also concluded that supervised group exercise yields better outcomes than unsupervised home exercise. They suggested that more high-quality trials are needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of exercise therapy for patients with spondyloarthritis.


# Physical activity in spondyloarthritis: a systematic review
- This article is a systematic review of observational studies that measured physical activity levels of adults with spondyloarthritis and compared them to the general population or physical activity guidelines. The authors found that adults with spondyloarthritis were less physically active than the general population and did not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines. They also found that physical activity was associated with lower disease activity, better function, and higher quality of life2


# Spondyloarthritis and Strength Training: A 4-Year Report3: This article is a case report of a 41-year-old man with peripheral spondyloarthritis who participated in a strength training program for four years. The authors reported that strength training improved his pain, function, muscle mass, bone mineral density, and cardiovascular risk factors. They also reported no adverse effects or disease exacerbation due to strength training3
