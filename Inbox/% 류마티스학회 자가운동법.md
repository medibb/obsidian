## The effect of physical exercise on rheumatoid arthritis: An overview of systematic reviews

This article is an overview of 10 systematic reviews that examined the effects of different types of exercise on various outcomes for people with rheumatoid arthritis. The authors found that:

Aerobic exercise improved aerobic capacity1
Strength training improved erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation) and 50-foot walking time1
Aerobic exercise combined with strength training improved aerobic capacity, physical function, and fatigue1
Hand exercise improved hand function1
Tai chi improved pain, stiffness, physical function, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and quality of life1
Yoga improved pain, disability, mood, and quality of life1
The authors concluded that exercise is beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis and recommended that health professionals should encourage them to participate in regular physical activity tailored to their individual needs and preferences.



## Physical activity, exercise and rheumatoid arthritis: Effectiveness, mechanisms and implementation1

This article is a review of the current evidence on how physical activity and exercise can benefit people with rheumatoid arthritis. The authors discussed:

The effectiveness of physical activity and exercise for improving symptoms such as pain, fatigue, disability, mood, sleep quality, and cardiovascular health1
The mechanisms by which physical activity and exercise can modulate inflammation, immune function, muscle strength, body composition, bone health, vascular function, and brain activity in rheumatoid arthritis1
The implementation of physical activity interventions in clinical practice, including barriers, facilitators, strategies, guidelines, recommendations, and examples of successful programs1
The authors concluded that physical activity and exercise are safe and effective interventions that can improve both local and systemic outcomes for people with rheumatoid arthritis. They suggested that rheumatology healthcare practitioners should lead the implementation of physical activity interventions in a pragmatic manner and supported by social innovation.




## Patient experiences of physical activity and exercise in rheumatoid arthritis: a qualitative study1

This article is a qualitative study that explored the views and experiences of people with rheumatoid arthritis regarding physical activity and exercise. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants who had varying levels of physical activity and exercise. The authors analyzed the data using thematic analysis and identified four main themes:

The meaning of physical activity and exercise: Participants had different definitions and understandings of what constituted physical activity and exercise, ranging from daily activities to structured programs1
The benefits and challenges of physical activity and exercise: Participants reported various benefits of being physically active or exercising, such as improved mood, mobility, pain management, self-esteem, social interaction, and quality of life. They also faced various challenges, such as fatigue, pain, fear of damage, lack of motivation, time constraints, accessibility issues, weather conditions, and conflicting advice1
The role of health professionals: Participants valued the support and guidance from health professionals regarding physical activity and exercise. They appreciated when health professionals were knowledgeable, empathetic, encouraging, realistic, individualized, flexible, consistent, and collaborative1
The role of self-management: Participants recognized the importance of self-management skills for engaging in physical activity and exercise. They used strategies such as goal setting, planning ahead, pacing themselves, listening to their bodies, monitoring their progress, rewarding themselves, seeking social support, and adapting to changing circumstances1
The authors concluded that physical activity and exercise are complex phenomena that are influenced by personal, social, environmental, and professional factors. They suggested that health professionals should adopt a patient-centered approach that considers the individual preferences, needs, and goals of people with rheumatoid arthritis.


# SpA exercise

## Exercise therapy for spondyloarthritis: a systematic review 
- This article is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of therapeutic exercise on pain, stiffness, quality of life, function, disease activity, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with spondyloarthritis. The authors found moderate evidence that exercise therapy improved pain, function, disease activity, and spinal mobility compared to usual care or no intervention1

- summary:  This article is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of therapeutic exercise on pain, stiffness, quality of life, function, disease activity, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with spondyloarthritis. The authors searched electronic databases and included 14 studies with a total of 1,032 participants. The authors performed a meta-analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
- The authors found:
	Moderate evidence that exercise therapy improved pain, function, disease activity, and chest expansion compared to usual care or no intervention1
	Low-level evidence that exercise therapy improved stiffness, spinal mobility, and cardiorespiratory function compared to usual care or no intervention1
	No evidence that exercise therapy improved quality of life compared to usual care or no intervention1
	No evidence that exercise therapy was superior to other interventions such as massage, hydrotherapy, or education1
	No evidence that different types or dosages of exercise therapy had different effects on outcomes1
	
- The authors concluded that therapeutic exercises are beneficial for adults with ankylosing spondylitis; effects on other spondyloarthritis subtypes are unknown. They also concluded that supervised group exercise yields better outcomes than unsupervised home exercise. They suggested that more high-quality trials are needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of exercise therapy for patients with spondyloarthritis.


## Physical activity in spondyloarthritis: a systematic review
- This article is a systematic review of observational studies that measured physical activity levels of adults with spondyloarthritis and compared them to the general population or physical activity guidelines. The authors found that adults with spondyloarthritis were less physically active than the general population and did not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines. They also found that physical activity was associated with lower disease activity, better function, and higher quality of life2
- summary
	The article aims to establish the physical activity levels of adults with spondyloarthritis and to compare them to the general population.
	The article reviews 12 studies that measured physical activity using questionnaires or accelerometers in patients with spondyloarthritis, mainly ankylosing spondylitis.
	The article finds that physical activity levels are lower in patients with spondyloarthritis than in healthy adults, and are associated with pain, stiffness, quality of life and other outcomes.
	The article suggests that there is a need for physical activity guidelines that are tailored to patients with spondyloarthritis, taking into account their specific needs and preferences.


## Spondyloarthritis and Strength Training: A 4-Year Report
- This article is a case report of a 41-year-old man with peripheral spondyloarthritis who participated in a strength training program for four years. The authors reported that strength training improved his pain, function, muscle mass, bone mineral density, and cardiovascular risk factors. They also reported no adverse effects or disease exacerbation due to strength training3


## Guideline: 
Some general guidelines are:

Physical activity should include four domains: aerobic, resistance, flexibility and neuro-motor exercise23.
Physical activity should be performed regularly, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise3. ()
Physical activity should be tailored to each individual’s needs, preferences and abilities23.
Physical activity should be supervised by a physical therapist or a trained instructor when possible2.
Physical activity should be balanced with rest and recovery periods1.
Balance exercises are especially important for people with spondyloarthritis as they can improve posture, stability and coordination1. Balance exercises should be performed 3 to 5 times per week for best results1.

# Enthesophyte & synovitis

Exercise can have different effects on enthesopathy, synovitis, and their prognosis depending on various factors.
[Here is some information from different sources](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318987)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318987)[2](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/fulltext/2020/11000/enthesopathy_an_underappreciated_role_in.12.aspx)[3](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/exercise-and-your-joints):

Enthesopathy is a condition that affects the entheses, which are the sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bones. It can cause pain, inflammation and stiffness in joints such as the heel, elbow or knee1.
Synovitis is a condition that affects the synovium, which is a thin layer of tissue that lines joint capsules. It can cause pain, swelling and reduced range of motion in joints such as the wrist, knee or ankle3.
Both enthesopathy and synovitis can be caused by overuse, injury or inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis12. They can also affect each other as inflammation in one tissue can spread to another2.
Exercise can have both beneficial and harmful effects on enthesopathy and synovitis depending on the type, intensity, frequency and duration of exercise23. Some general guidelines are:
Exercise should be moderate and balanced with rest periods to avoid overloading or injuring the tissues123.
Exercise should be tailored to each individual’s needs, preferences and abilities based on their diagnosis, symptoms and goals23.
Exercise should include a variety of activities that target different aspects of fitness such as aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercises23.
Exercise should be supervised by a physical therapist or a trained instructor when possible to ensure proper technique and safety[2].
Exercise can benefit enthesopathy and synovitis by improving blood flow, nutrient delivery, tissue healing, joint lubrication, muscle strength, joint stability, posture alignment, pain relief and quality of life[1] [ 2] [ 3].
Exercise can also improve the prognosis of enthesopathy and synovitis by preventing or delaying further damage or complications such as joint deformity, cartilage loss, bone erosion, disability and depression [2] [ 3].


# Benefits of aerobic & resistive exercise
Aerobic and resistive exercise can have different benefits on inflammatory disease depending on various factors. Here is some information from different sources[1](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2014/08000/role_of_exercise_on_inflammation_and_chronic.12.aspx)[2](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2014/08000/role_of_exercise_on_inflammation_and_chronic.12.aspx)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32249021/)[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521694220300218):

Inflammatory disease is a term that refers to a group of conditions that involve chronic inflammation in different parts of the body, such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis3.
Inflammation is a normal immune response that helps fight infections and heal injuries, but when it becomes persistent or excessive, it can cause damage to healthy tissues and organs3.
Aerobic exercise is a type of physical activity that involves continuous movement of large muscle groups at moderate to high intensity for a prolonged period of time, such as running, cycling or swimming1.
Resistive exercise is a type of physical activity that involves contracting muscles against an external resistance for a short period of time, such as lifting weights, using elastic bands or doing bodyweight exercises1.

- Aerobic exercise can benefit inflammatory disease by reducing the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (chemical messengers that promote inflammation) by immune cells such as monocytes1. It can also increase the production and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines by muscle cells such as interleukin-104.
- Resistive exercise can benefit inflammatory disease by increasing muscle mass and strength, which can improve joint stability, mobility and function2. It can also reduce body fat mass, which can lower systemic inflammation levels2.
- Both aerobic and resistive exercise can benefit inflammatory disease by improving cardiovascular health, metabolic health, mental health and quality of life 2,3,4.
