This study is a prospective cohort study with Level ___3 evidence.

## 2.1 Patients

We enrolled the 18~40 years old healthy subjects and received the informed consent. Subjects who has recent trauma, or knee joint pain in recent 6 month, or diagnosed with knee joint disease were excluded. We intended to drop out the subjects who want to stop during experiments with discomfort, pain or any other reason, but no one dropped out from our experiments. Finally, 20 knees from 20 subjects were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pukyung National University and was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.

## 2.2 Clinical parameters

Demographic data, including age, sex, height, weight, INBODY?, knee joint circumference, and the range of motion of tested knee were obtained. All subjects live in Korea, 1 subjects has ____  ethnity?. The subjects informed to perform the three activities. Active knee extension at chair sitting were performed first. At the resting phase, the chair height and depth was adjusted to lean the trunk and maintain the hip joint as 90 degree flexion, lower thigh just above the knee joint was rested in seat. The seat was raised to the enough height that the whole lower leg just naturally dropped with gravity and the knee joint maintain 90 degree. At the active extension, subject was informed to raising the lower leg in self-selected speed. during thigh are still rested in seat, so that the knee extended to end-range. Subjects extend and maintain the knee posture for 7 seconds and return to resting position.

Second, passive range of motion at decubitus position were performed. Subjects were informed to side-lying and cushion were placed between both lower thigh to knee joint area so that the subject do not use the abductor of tested legs for maintain the height. And the examiner flex the knee joint in two steps, flex the knee joint to 90 degrees from 180 degrees and then flex to end-range flexion angle.  Passive extension was also in two step and repeat flexion-extension again.

Lastly, restricted half squat till 90 degrees of knee flexion was perfomed. 제한된 평행스쿼트: 무게를 사용하지 않고 맨몸으로 시행하는 평행 스쿼트로서, 어깨 넓이로 정면을 보고 바로 선 상태에서 양손을 앞으로 평행하게 뻗고, 무릎이 발끝보다 앞으로 나가지 않도록 제한하며, 허벅지가 지면과 평행이 될 때까지의 깊이까지 천천히 앉았다가 다시 바로 서는 스쿼트로서 균일한 속도로 총 2회 반복 시행한다.

## 2.3 Potential analysis from surface electrode

We used gel-type electrode which has advantage for accuracy of measure. The electrodes were placed around the knee joints such as upper 1/3 part of the patella according to midline, upper and lower retinaculum area at each medial and lateral sides, medial and lateral joint line according to previously reported area, and mid-point of popliteal crease (Figure 1).

The 8 electrode were connected with ____ receiver and ____ (machine explanation). A sampling rate was 200 Hz and band pass filter were used with _____. The data stored in a local memory with ______.

## 2.4 Post-processing of electroarthrographic data

The raw electric signals were transformed to root mean square (RMS)____. The potentials were divided into each flexion degrees. To calculate the amplitudes, the initial and finish time points at just before and after knee joint movement were annotated on the electrical potentials. However, even though all subjects were changed their knee angle during a second. In a second, they choose the speed as self-selected natural speed. So exact point that the movements ends were identified as the inflection point which were observed in all graphs. If there are the noise signals around the movements, the time point annotated before the start of the noise signal or after its end. most obvious time points which maintain the potentials shown at least 1 electrode were regarded as the true time point.

In many potentials detected at ant. Knee. the potential changes after end of movements were observed and reached to some values. (Similar  shape were observed in active and passive extension, squat show different graphs). so total changed potential was also measured during maintain the positions

## 2.5 Ultrasonographic procedure

 연골두께, 연골말단으로부터 체표면까지의 거리, soft tissue depth? 를 초음파를 이용하여 측정한다. The ultrasonography was done by a physiatrist with more than 10 years of musculoskeletal practice who was blinded to the patients’ electroarthrographic characteristics and clinical information. Subjects were sitting on the chair with the same resting position as the active knee extension. While the subjects were asked to same movements as much as possible, a 13 MHz linear ultrasound probe (Clarius L15 HD3; Clarius Mobile health, Vancouver, Canada) was spread with coupling gel and placed on the area that surface electrodes were placed in the axial orientation to the femur (Figure 2). We identified the vertical depth and underlying soft tissue characteristics under the electrode attaching positions. At 90-degree flexion, electrode 1 always lying on patellar bone….etc

## 2.6 Statistical analysis

were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance of _p_ %3C 0.05. To adjust for baseline imbalance between groups, we proceeded with a multivariable analysis using generalized linear (GLM) model with gamma identity link function. The demographic and clinical parameters were used as covariates and magnitude of effects were reported with the effect size based on estimate of GLM All statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical software version 3.5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

선정된 연구 대상자는 표면전극을 무릎관절 주변의 피부 16군데에 부착하고 두가지 분석을 시행한다. 첫째로 부하를 추가하거나 보조한 상태에서 피측정 하지에 체중을 부하하거나 감소시켜, 전체부하의 증가와 감소에 따른 관절연골의 유동전위 변화량을 측정 및 분석한다. 다음으로는 표준화된 ‘의자에 앉아 다리펴기(leg extension in chair sitting)’ 와 ‘제한된 평행스쿼트(Restricted parallel squat)’ 동작에서의 전형적인 관절연골의 전위의 위상변화를 측정한다.
