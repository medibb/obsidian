show me the  r & shiny code acting as follow: showing 'pain diagram' to user, user draw a simple annotation, and save the picture

Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide visual outputs. However, I can give you the code for a basic R Shiny app that allows the user to draw on an image and save it as a file. 

Here's an example code for you:

```
library(shiny)

# Define UI
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Pain Diagram"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      actionButton("clear", "Clear"),
      br(),
      downloadButton("downloadData", "Download")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("plot1", click = "plot_click")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Load pain diagram image
  img_url <- "https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/c75951e94fc951f7224891b9a1906869265877d5/3-Figure1-1.png"
  img <- readPNG(img_url)
  
  # Initialize variables
  clicked_points <- reactiveValues()
  
  # Draw plot with image
  output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
    plot(1:10, type = "n", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "")
    rasterImage(img, xleft = 0.5, ybottom = 0.5, xright = 9.5, ytop = 9.5)
    
    # Add points if clicked by user
    if (!is.null(clicked_points$x)) {
      points(clicked_points$x, clicked_points$y, col = "red", pch = 16)
    }
    
    # Clear points if button is clicked
    observeEvent(input$clear,{
      clicked_points$x <- NULL
      clicked_points$y <- NULL
    })
    
    # Save image if button is clicked
    output$downloadData <- downloadHandler(
      filename = function() {
        paste0("pain_diagram_", Sys.Date(), ".png")
      },
      
      content = function(file) {
        png(file)
        plot(1:10, type = "n", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "")
        rasterImage(img, xleft = 0.5, ybottom = 0.5, xright = 9.5, ytop=9.5)
        if (!is.null(clicked_points$x)) {
          points(clicked_points$x,
                 clicked_points$y,
                 col="red",
                 pch=16)
        }
        dev.off()
      }
      
    )
    
  })
  
   # Record clicks on plot and store in reactiveValues object 
   observeEvent(input$plot_click,{
     click_x <- round(input$plot_click$x)
     click_y <- round(input$plot_click$y)
     if(click_x <8 & click_x>2 & click_y <8 & click_y>2){
       isolate({
         clicked_points$x<-c(clicked_points$x,
                             input$plot_click$x)
         clicked_points$y<-c(clicked_points$y,
                             input$plot_click$y)}
       )
     }
     
   })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui=ui , server=server )
```

This code will display a pain diagram image in the center of the app window and allow the user to draw on it using their mouse cursor. Whenever the user clicks on the image with their mouse cursor in a specific area (between (2-8), (2-8)), a red dot will be placed at that location.

The 'Clear' button allows users to clear all previous annotations made on the picture.

The 'Download' button saves an image of the annotated pain diagram as a PNG file with a filename following `pain_diagram_<date>.png` where `<date>` is replaced by today's date.

Users can use this code to create their own Shiny app that displays any other images they want to annotate and save annotations made by users as


error: package ‘readPNG’ is not available for this version of R

As an AI language model, I do not have information on the version of R you are using. However, this error message suggests that the R package 'readPNG' is not available or compatible with the version of R you are using. You may need to update your R version or use a different package to read PNG files. Alternatively, try installing the package from a different repository or source. You can check the CRAN website for more information on available packages and their compatibility with different versions of R.

reading png package work in r 4.2.2. version

As an AI language model, I do not have a personal experience of using R 4.2.2 version. However, the png package is a commonly used package in R and should work in version 4.2.2 as well. You can install the package using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("png")
```

Once installed, you can load the package using the library() function:

``` r
library(png)
```

And then use its functions to read or write PNG files:

``` r
img <- readPNG("myimage.png")
writePNG(img, "newimage.png")
```

Note that you may need to install additional dependencies for the png package to work properly, such as libpng on Linux systems.
