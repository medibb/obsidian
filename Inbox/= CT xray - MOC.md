## 4. Method

8 bit grayscale histogram was used, which classifies the black-and-white brightness level of the picture into 256 intensities ranging from 0 to 255. Spatial heterogeneity was assessed by skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and complexity. The relationship with pain assessed by numeric rating scale (NRS) was investigated by Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson chi-square test.

### 4.1 Parameter definitions
- Clinical paramters : nRS, positive provocative test, capsular vs impinge sign
- ultrasonographic paramters : grading system, shadow

### 4.2. Data analysis ([[= EAG - Data Analysis]])

#### Data processing
 - Env: R
 - code: 



#### Statistical analysis

## 5. Results

The mean age of subjects was 56.35 ± 8.28. 

In the standardized grayscale brightness level, mean and quartile values were significantly higher in calcifications compared with normal tendons.

In the spatial heterogeneity parameters, all parameters except kurtosis had statistically significant differences between calcifications and normal tendons. 

When patients were divided according to NRS 5 and compared, there were statistically significant differences in the size of calcification and sex, but the grayscale value and spatial heterogeneity could not show a significant difference.

---
## 6 Discussion & Hypothesis
Through grayscale histogram, the calcific deposits showed not only higher grayscale brightness levels, but also differences in spatial heterogeneity with more skewness, higher entropy, and lower complexity. 

The correlation analysis with pain reconfirmed the well-known relationship with size and there was no statistical significance with the quantitative parameters, 

but these heterogeneity differences may reflect the pathological formation-resorption cycle of calcification and could build background knowledge for detection and segmentation of calcific deposit on radiographs. Future studies could reveal these.
