# ABSTRACT

Electroarthrography are newly introduced concept for diagnosing arhtirits and cartilage degradation of knee joint by non-invasively observing the potential around the joint. However, reliable electrode systems are not clinically validated yet and the interpretation of signal are restricted. We investigated the reliable electrode position with anatomical relevance and how the electrical signal around knee joint differs by physical activities.

We analyzed 20 knees from 20subjects. 8 surface electrodes were attached to knee joint and sample the electrical signal with 200 Hz frequency. Passive range of motion at decubitus, active knee extension at chair sitting, and half squat were performed during the electrography and accompanying soft tissue changes (depth, composition) were recorded with ultrasound. Amplitude of knee joint at flexion &extension from each activity were compared. The noise signals and phasal reversal of knee joint were compared with ultrasonographic findings. Each potential at each angle of knee joint were also compared at passive ROM.

All graphs show significant potential changes according to flexion angles. Potentials during squat showed higher amplitudes(__Â±__mV) compared to passive & active extension. Full flexion showed most low amplitudes of __Â±__mV, but some potentials show reversal of amplitude. 90 to 0 degree show frequent phase reversal and mean amplitude were __Â±__mV.

Ultrasonographic findings show that large fat tissues and deep tissue depth are correlated with low amplitudes. Phase reversal show tend to ____ , although not statistically significant. Most reliable electrode positions were ____. A, B, and C show similar pattern so that B could be used as the representative one. Electrode on post. Knee also show diagnostic values despite vast of muscle masses (of gastrocnemius head and popliteus). The cartilages electrical potentials and characteristics are detected by surface electrodes on the knee joint. Electroarthrography on physical activities could be utilized for evaluating the risks of rehabilitative exercise and assessing the loads placed on joints.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A
B

To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first study to report the A. In this study, the authors identified the A.
  

# 2 METHODS

This study is a prospective cohort study with Level ___3 evidence.

## 2.1 Patients

We enrolled the 18~40 years old healthy subjects and received the informed consent. Subjects who has recent trauma, A in recent 6 month, or diagnosed with A disease were excluded. We intended to drop out the subjects who want to stop during experiments with discomfort, pain or any other reason, but no one dropped out from our experiments. Finally, B subjects were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pukyung National University and was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.

## 2.2 Clinical parameters

Demographic data, including age, sex, height, weight, A were obtained. All subjects live in Korea. 


## 2.3 A analysis

(Figure 1).

## 2.4 Post-processing of data

## 2.5 Statistical analysis

were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance of _p_ < 0.05. To adjust for baseline imbalance between groups, we proceeded with a multivariable analysis using generalized linear (GLM) model with gamma identity link function. The demographic and clinical parameters were used as covariates and magnitude of effects were reported with the effect size based on estimate of GLM All statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical software version 3.5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
