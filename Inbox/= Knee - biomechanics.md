# contact point of femoral condyle
contact point 가 뒤로 가는데, medial condyle 은 작게 움직이고 lateral condyle 은 많이 움직인다. 그러다보니까 medial pivot 하는 모양새

Nevertheless, as shown in the figure, when the knee is flexed from 0° to 120°, the model predicts that the contact point between the femur and the tibia, shown by arrows, will displace posteriorly
If the average of the motion of the lateral and medial femoral condyles is taken, this prediction is correct. In reality, the medial condyle displaces only a small amount, while the lateral condyle displaces to the very posterior.

# tibia rotation 
굴곡시 int rotation / 신전시 lateral rotation of tibia
int rotation 이 시계반대방향, 굴곡시에는 contact point 가 뒤로 가는데, tibia 가 int. rotation 하면서 femoral condyle입장에서는 앞으로 가는 셈이 아닐까.

The kinematics in extension are complex and are characterized by a “screw-home” mechanism, where the tibia rotates externally 
This action is caused by the large sagittal radii of the distal-anterior femoral condyles, the shallow anterior lateral tibia, and the upsweep on the anterior medial tibia

The ligaments themselves can elongate a few millimeters under tension, whereas the cartilage surfaces can deform up to 0.5 to 1.0 mm. These factors allow for guided motion of the knee but with a considerable amount of laxity, especially in axial rotation.

# meniscus
접촉면적을 넓혀서 스트레스분산하고 활액을 연골면에 모아서 lubrication 역할을 
The menisci aid in distributing the stresses and reducing the pressures imposed on the tibial plateaus
They prevent undue forward gliding (sliding) of the femur on the tibia, analogous to a chock under a wheel: on the lateral side, this applies at the extremes of motion due to the anterior–posterior mobility of the meniscus; on the medial side, this occurs anteriorly in early flexion and posteriorly in late flexion. They distribute weight across the joint by increasing the area of contact: This has been supported by subsequent studies. They assist in the lubrication of the joint: this will occur by replenishing the synovial fluid over the cartilage surfaces during flexion

The results confirmed that from 0° to 90° flexion, the menisci carried at least 50% of the load. When the menisci were removed, the contact areas reduced by 50% and the average contact stresses doubled.
