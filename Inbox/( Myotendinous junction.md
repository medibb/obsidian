Tendon의 방향은 longitudinal 하지만 근육으로 다가올수록 laterally transmission 한다. 



==However close to the muscle the force can be in many directions. This allows force transmission laterally via the endomysium to adjacent myofibres.==

[[muscle]] [[physiology]] 와 관련된 protein 들
==There are at least two cytoskeletal proteins, vinculin and talin, that are involved in linking the thin filaments to the extracellular structural proteins. There is a separate structural link that traverses the cell membrane of the muscle called integrin, existing within the cell membrane at the MTJ.==
