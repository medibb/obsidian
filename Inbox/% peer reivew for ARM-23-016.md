Comments to the Author  
The authors conduct an interesting study on the influence of Forward head posture correction using global(cervicothoracic & lubar) spinal program on craniovertebral angle, neck disability and spinal muscle activity. 


I do think more rationale how the exercise program could change the CVA and greater explanation as to an anatomical or biomechanical standpoint would be needed.

Introduction  
- page 2 line 33 - 9 referece 는 해당 문장을 뒷받침해주지 못합니다.

	- line 37 neck pain 환자에서 neck pain 이 없는 환자도 많다는 것은 또한 FHP 가 원인이 아닐수도 있다는 의미도 됩니다. spinal muscle imbalance와 관련된 FHP 를 교정하는 것이 중요하다고 하였는데 어떠한 imbalance 가 존재했고 intervention 을 통해  어떻게 교정되었는지 제시할 필요가 있습니다. 이 후 내용에서 제시되지 않고 있습니다.
	- line 40 - 또한 muscle imbalance 만을 교정하여 FHP 를 교정하려고 제시하는 것은 추측입니다. 어떠한 muscle imbalance 의 교정이 있었는지 더 자세히 제시하는 것이 필요하겠습니다.
	- line 42 - Cervicothoracic intervention 이 flexibility 와 strengrh를 개선하였다는데 대한 reference 가 필요합니다.

	- line 59 - 이 부분은 method section 에 어울립니다.
	- line 71 - exclusion criteria 에서 수술하였거나 , severe pain 이 있는 사람은 제외되었으므로 그것을 결론에 포함시켜야 되겠습니다. severe pain 의 기준이 무엇인지 기술하는 것이 필요합니다.
	- line 74 - 30세 미만의 젊은 여성이라는 매우 제한적인 대상자에 대한 결과라는 것을 limitation 뿐만아니라 title 과 conclusion에 포함시켜서 보고하는 것이 올바르겠습니다. 
	  30세 이하의 젊은 여성에서 NDI 를 가지고 있다는 것은 현재 통증을 가진 환자라는 것으로 퇴행성 변화와 통증이 없는 젊은 여성들이 목 통증으로 인한 neck disability를 가지게 된 원인이 무엇인지, 본 연구의 exclusion criteria 로 제외되지 않은 neck spinal diesease 를 가지고 있는 것은 아닌지 명확히 제시될 필요가 있습니다. 그렇지 않다면 어떻게 subject 의 painful neck 의 heterogenous condition 을 control 하였는지 보여줄 필요가 있습니다.
painful neck 에 의한 transient CV angle reduction 의 4주 동안 natural course 로의 회복을 배제할 수 없다.  
degenerative disc disease, birth defect, tumor, infection, systemic disease가 통증과 CV angle reduction 의 co-variate 일 수 있으며, degenerative disc 의 natural healing에 따른 improvement 를 배제하기 위한 robust 한 subject description 이 필요하다.
	- line 75 - 여성에서 근력이 약한 것은 맞지만 NDI의 prevalence가 높다는 근거가 필요합니다. 20번 reference 는 해당 근거가 되지 않습니다.
- page 4
	- line 83 - intervention 을 하지 않고 경과관찰을 시행한 comntrol group 이 필요합니다. 윤리적문제로 치료를 시행하지 않을 수 없었다면 해당 내용에 대한 기술이 필요하겠습니다. 다만, 자세 교육과 스트레칭 운동만을 시행한 그룹을 control 로 생성하는 것은 윤리적 문제를 야기하지 않을 수 있을 것으로 생각됩니다.

	- line 100 - technical 부분은 잘 묘사하고 있다고 생각됩니다. 다만 환자에게 어떻게 서있으라고 지시하였는지, 어디를 주시하라고 하였는지 기술하는 것이 필요합니다. 해당 카메라 측정은 head and trunk rotation 에 영향을 받을 수 있으므로 이를 어떻게 제어하였는지 혹은 보정하였는지 기술이 필요합니다.
또한 radiographic CV angle과의 상관성을 기술해주어야 한다.
• Page 4 line 45- more introduction into the rationale, biomechanics, and aim of the study would be helpful prior to jumping into the technique. This section may be better included in the methods.  
• Page 5 line 10- the aims here state that you will be investigating the diagnostic value, though I am not sure the methods are necessarily set up to demonstrate the diagnostic value of this test (i.e differentiating those with OA vs those without).  The phrase ‘regarding different clinical situations’ is not clear- I would make this more explicit. I would also include a hypothesis statement.  
Methods  
• Page 5 line 26- why was the large volume injection mechanism used in these patients? Is this part of clinically indicated care or from a prior research protocol? I am not familiar with these large volume injections with pressure monitoring being part of routine clinical care.  
• Were there any other exclusion or inclusion criteria, ie age, diagnosis of OA, inflammatory arthritis, duration of disease, recent trauma ect? Were patients excluded if they had recent injection or aspirations?  
• Were other treatments such as NSAIDs or PT permitted in tandem with the large volume injections?  
• How were pain complaints quantified – was a validated scale used (ie KOOS, WOMAC, VAS)?  
• Who performed the injections and ultrasound- was this done with a provider experienced in ultrasound?  
• The biomechanical measurements (volume, pressure and slope measurements) will likely not be familiar to many readers and clinicians. I feel that much more background on what these parameters are measuring and why they may be clinically relevant is needed.  
• The methods should outline how you characterized/dichotomized pain  
• In the multivariable analysis were the ‘clinical parameters’ also considered as covariates? For instance, if KL grade was the exposure, was this model adjusted for the presence of effusion ect? If not it would be interesting to see if the results stratified by KL grade change after adjustment for effusion. I would assume that effusion was seen more often in those with ‘definite OA’ or KL>2. Same holds with stratification by pain given the pain-synovitis association.  
Results  
• Page 9 line 11- capitalization typo (The initial)  
• It would be helpful to have mention of the number of participants, age, sex and KL distribution mentioned in the beginning of the results. I would also reference Table 1 in the text.  
• Since knees with effusion already have volume within the join capsule isn’t it expected that these knees would demonstrate reduced Vph1? Was the baseline intra-articular pressure in patients with effusion greater?  Is this something that should be adjusted for since these patients may start out with greater volume/pressure at baseline? How do you tease apart pressure changes due to synovial membrane stiffness from pressure changes due larger volume (ie pre-existing effusion + infused volume).  
Discussion  
• Page 11 line 41- an explanation such as this would be very helpful in the intro or methods to familiarize the reader with what these biomechanical parameters mean from an anatomical or clinical standpoint.  Same holds for the discussion on page 12 line 20.  
• Page 10 line 38- how many of the patients with painful flexion also were classified as definite OA?  
• Page 10 line 48- it would be helpful to better understand what the significance is of monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic profiles is. I confess I do not inherently understand the clinical significance of this and fear that other readers may struggle as well. I would also better define what the ‘toe’ region is.  
• Page 11 line 20- I am not sure of the relevance of these RA findings to this particular study or the following discussion of capsular rupture. Is the summarizing sentence here suggesting that capsular preserving HD on knee joints could be more beneficial than capsular rupture? If so this conclusion may be a bit outside the scope of the current study.  
• While pressure monitoring HD may be able to identify synovial stiffness, I do not see how this necessarily aides in the diagnosis of OA. This study highlights that patients with radiographic OA have greater synovial stiffness but does not really address cut-points or norms that suggest it may augment early diagnosis.  
• In the last paragraph it is noted that all patients fit ACR OA criteria- this would be helpful information to have in the methods
