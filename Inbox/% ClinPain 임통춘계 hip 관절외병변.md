# Overview
## muscle and tendon injury

-   3 category : tendinous avulsion, muscle contusion, and myotendinous strain
-   Acute avulsion - deceleration or eccentric contraction to tensile overload
-   Chronic avulsion - repetitive stress or overuse
-   muscle contusion - blunt trauma
-   Iliopsoas inj - sports, trauma / m/c - LT

-   avulsion - in adults, commonly pathologic fracture, malignancy related
-   trauma in skeletally immature patients

# Ant. hip pain 
## Iliopsoas tendon
### epidemiology
- sport inj & trauma, m/c - LT
- avulsion - in adults, commonly pathologic fracture, malignancy related trauma in skeletally immature patients
•Snapping hip syndrome - sudden, painful, and audible snapping
	• Typically seen in young, physically active adults.
	•Symptoms : reproduced with specific movements; frog-leg to neutral.
	•Extra- or intra-articular causes
	•Extra articular; internal or external.
	•External extra-articular : lateral structures, the iliotibial band and gluteus maximus muscle.
	- symptom: Snapping occurs as these structures pass over the greater trochanter during hip flexion and extension.

### Dx  
- PEx: Due to the easily reproducible symptoms with hip flexion and extension, this diagnosis is usually made clinically with out imaging.

Ultrasound is extremely useful in evaluating the iliopsoas

tendon in hip snapping because it allows dynamic evaluation

of the tendon during snapping and also allows evaluation of

the tendon for pathology and associated bursitis

The adductor magnus originates from the

ischial tuberosity and pubis and inserts onto the linea aspera,

supracondylar femur, and adductor tubercle of the distal

medial femur.

Adductor insertion avulsion syndrome is a painful condi tion affecting the femur at the insertion of the adductor mus cles and is also known as thigh splints

The gluteus medius attaches onto the

posterior superior and lateral facets, and a portion blends

with the gluteus minimus tendon to insert onto the anterior

facet

nearly always present in greater trochanteric pain syndrome

; Iliopsoas impingement, subspine impingement, ischiofemoral impingement,

epidemiology / ischiofemoral impingement - quadratus femoris between LT and Ischium

QF에서 edema 100%

Impingement has been shown to be

associated with an ischiofemoral distance of less than or

equal to 17 mm and the space between the hamstring tendon

origin and iliopsoas tendon insertion measuring less than or

equal to 8 mm. This abnormality can cause hip pain which is

not easily localized on clinical exam so is best assessed by

MR imaging

On MR imaging, the quadratus femo ris can be edematous, partially torn, and/or atrophied,

depending on the chronicity of the impingement (Fig. 23.9).

Associated hamstring tendon origin abnormalities also are

commonly seen.

Bing information

I hope this summary helps you. Do you have any questions? 😊

받은 메시지. Hello, this is Bing. I can help you summarize the diagnosis and treatment of some extra articular hip pathologies. Extra articular hip pathologies are conditions that affect the structures around the hip joint, such as tendons, muscles, bursae, nerves, and fascia. Here are some examples: 

- **External snapping hip**: This is caused by irritation of the greater trochanter by the iliotibial band or gluteus maximus tendon. It causes a snapping sensation or sound on the lateral side of the hip during movement. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and ultrasound. Treatment options include stretching exercises, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and surgery. 

- **Internal snapping hip**: This is caused by movement of the iliopsoas tendon over a bony prominence such as the iliopectineal eminence or femoral head. It causes a snapping sensation or sound on the anterior or medial side of the hip during movement. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment options include stretching exercises, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, botulinum toxin injections, and surgery. 

- **Rectus femoris tendinosis**: This is degeneration of the rectus femoris tendon at its origin from the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) . It causes anterior hip pain that worsens with flexion and extension [^4 ^][5]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and MRI[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, platelet-rich plasma injections, and surgery[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. 

- **Fibrosis of AIIS fat pad**: This is thickening and scarring of the fat pad located under the AIIS due to chronic inflammation or trauma[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. It causes anterior hip pain that worsens with flexion and extension[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and MRI[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and surgery to remove the fibrotic tissue and decompress the nerve endings in the fat pad [^1 ^[2 ^[4 ^[5]. 

- **Adhesion of gluteal or rectus femoris muscles**: This is abnormal attachment of these muscles to each other or to other structures due to chronic inflammation or trauma[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ^][5]. It causes anterior hip pain that worsens with flexion and extension[^1 ^][2 ^][4 ][5 ]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and MRI[ 1 ][ 2 ][ 4 ][ 5 ]. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and surgery to release the adhesions and restore normal muscle function[ 1 ][ 2 ][ 4 ][ 5 ]. I hope this summary helps you. Do you have any questions? 😊

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some more examples of extra articular hip pathologies: 
- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome**: This is inflammation of the bursa that cushions the greater trochanter from friction with muscles and tendons[^3 ^]. It causes lateral hip pain that worsens with pressure or movement[^3 ^]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and ultrasound[^3 ^]. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and surgery to remove the inflamed bursa or repair the damaged tendons [^3 ^]. 

- **Meralgia paresthetica**: This is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that supplies sensation to the outer thigh[^3 ^]. It causes numbness, tingling, burning, or pain on the lateral side of the thigh[^3 ^]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and nerve conduction studies[^3 ^]. Treatment options include wearing loose clothing, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and surgery to decompress or transect the nerve[^3 ^]. 

- **Piriformis syndrome**: This is irritation of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle that runs from the sacrum to the femur[^3 ^]. It causes buttock pain that radiates down the back of the leg and worsens with sitting, squatting, or internal rotation of the hip [^3 ^]. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and MRI[ 3 ]. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and surgery to release the piriformis muscle or divide the sciatic nerve[ 3 ]. 

- **Ischiofemoral impingement**: This is narrowing of the space between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter due to anatomical variations or trauma[^3 ^]. It causes posterior hip pain that worsens with extension and external rotation of the hip . Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and MRI . Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and surgery to increase the space between the structures . 

- **Osteitis pubis**: This is inflammation of the pubic symphysis and surrounding muscles due to overuse or trauma . It causes groin pain that worsens with weight-bearing activities such as running or kicking . Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and X-ray . Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, corticosteroid injections, and surgery to stabilize the pubic symphysis . I hope this summary helps you. Do you have any questions? 😊
