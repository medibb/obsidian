BACPAC is a research program funded by the NIH HEAL Initiative that aims to find effective and personalized therapies for chronic low back pain (cLBP)¹. It involves studying the biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors that cause cLBP and developing innovative technologies to measure and treat it¹²³⁴. BACPAC also has a mobile app that connects to a wearable device that can monitor the biomechanical factors of cLBP⁵.
