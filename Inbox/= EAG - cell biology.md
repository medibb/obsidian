- The observation that chondrocytes can respond to loading through voltage-gated ion channels (Tanaka et al. 2005; Mouw et al. 2007;Srinivasanetal.2015) has further highlighted the role of the SGP in AC and IVD mechanotransduction

AC similarly undergoes a diurnal cycle of fluid exudation/recovery of water content, where diurnal strains can be expected to range between 1 and 6%, dependent on AC location (Coleman et al. [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12551-021-00779-9#ref-CR13 "Coleman JL, Widmyer MR, Leddy HA et al (2013) Diurnal variations in articular cartilage thickness and strain in the human knee. J Biomech 46:541–547.
