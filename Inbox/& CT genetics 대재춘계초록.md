**Multiple calcific tendinitis patients with gene mutation associated with ectopic calcification: A case series.**

Department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, Kosin University College of medicine

Introduction

Recent studies have suggested that genetic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of calcific tendinitis. In this case report, we conducted a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis on three patients diagnosed with multiple calcific tendinopathies who we hypothesize may exhibit a more pronounced genetic or metabolic etiology of calcific tendinopathy compared to patients with calcific tendinopathy in single tendon.

Case report

Three patients aged between 50 and 70 with recurrent episodes of pain at multiple tendons are currently receiving treatment at the outpatient department of rehabilitation medicine. Radiograph and ultrasound imaging revealed calcification in ≥4 tendons around the shoulder and hip joints in all three patients.

None of the patients had a history of endocrine or autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, there was no notable family history or history of past trauma to the calcification site.

Anteroposterior radiographs of both shoulders and hips were obtained for **all** three patients, and ultrasound examinations were performed on the painful areas. Periarticular calcium deposition was detected in either unilateral or bilateral greater tuberosity of humerus, greater trochanter of femur, and ischial tuberosity in **all** three patients, as shown in Figure 1. 

These locations correspond to the origin of the rotator cuff, gluteal tendon, and hamstring tendon, and ultrasound confirmed the calcification of the tendon. The observed calcium deposition had a cloud-like nummular appearance characteristic of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals, and no prominent chondrocalcinosis was detected in the radiographs.

In the laboratory findings, during episodes of acute pain, Patient #1 and Patient #3 showed a mild elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) but not in high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), while patient #2 did not show any elevation in ESR or hs-CRP. And the factors related to mineralization metabolism were within the normal range in all three patients.

WES analysis was performed on all three patients.

Three patients showed a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the heterozygous state in the ALPL, ABCC6, and XPR1 genes, respectively (Table 2). Mutations in these genes are known to induce ectopic mineralization by affecting extracellular mineral homeostasis.

Discussion

We performed WES analysis on three patients with multifocal, recurrent calcific tendinitis and identified gene mutations associated with ectopic calcification in all three patients. 

although VUS에 대한 내용
해당 gene 들의 알려지지 않은 phenotype 이 calcific tendinitis 일 수 있고, 더 포괄적인 genetic predisposition 에 대한 검사가 필요하다. 왜냐면 석회는 퇴행성 질환과 다르게, 휴지기를 갖다가 활성화되고 없어지고 다시 재발하는 자연경과를 보여주고 있기 때문이다.

This finding suggests that genetics may contribute to the development of calcific tendinopathy. And further studies are needed to establish correlations between gene mutations associated with ectopic calcification and their phenotypes in order to identify the genetic risk factors and potential biomarkers associated with calcific tendinopathy

A. The left anterolateral shoulder radiograph shows calcium deposition adjacent to left greater tuberosity of the humerus.

B. The anterolateral hip radiograph shows calcium deposition adjacent to both great trochanters and left ischial tuberosity.

C. The ultrasound examination of the left shoulder show calcification on the insertion site of the left supraspinatus tendon.
